PotemkinLoader is a Lua script for The Powder Toy meant for testing scripts on platforms such as Android where there is currently no easy way for developers to debug or test compatibility in a timely manner.

To use PotemkinLoader, upload your script using pastebin, pybin.pw, github gists, or any other server that your testing device can access.

PotemkinLoader is NOT meant for use by non-developers. It contains no safeguards against malicious scripts and is only meant for use in cases where the user created the remote file.
